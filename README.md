# scripts

To use this scripts drop files in "autorun/client".
Example's:
On Windows: C:/Steam/steamapps/Garrys Mod/garrysmod/lua/autorun/client/
On Linux: /steam/steamapps/Garrys Mod/garrysmod/lua/autorun/client/
On MacOS: I don't know, never used MacOS before. But I think the directory is similar to other OS.

Good Luck.
